New in this draft are link colors specific to this template that are carefully developed from the latest version of the license free version of w3 css and a much nicer sidebar that comes with the w3 css. There are no third party providers for this website, so it is entirely yours. There is no proprietary code, though css standards change from time to time. The code that structures these pages is provided by World Wide Web Consortium without obligation and is free for you to modify and use as you wish, however we do recommend that you check your work with the CSS and HTML Validators before you upload to a live server it if you do (https://validator.w3.org/). 

Keep the contents of the template folder with you (along with any other records and references such as: photos, videos, or other kinds of media or source you may need to substantiate your claim. You may or may not choose to refer to the location of these additional files in your log, subdirectory, or open letter. And you may, or may not also choose to keep a list of the items you need and where you can find them on paper, but you will want to keep them with you, or in a place where you know they'll stay safe.

You can keep a copy of your website on an http server by placing all the file and folders as they are in your download on the root-level directory (public_html, or htdocs folder) and edit whenever necessary by saving a change to your local server with FTP. Just change the dates on your sitemap and replace the domain name 'example.com' with your own domain name when you do. The robot text files also need updating to correct for a domain name you choose, and you may, or may not choose to block access to other files and folders in your directory besides the defaults that I list. 

I've added subdirectory logs (new in this version) which you may choose to block, just keep in mind that some hacks will go directly to this file to find out where you keep your secrets in order to go to work on them, so you may choose to change the name of robot.txt as well. 

I've added comments to help you learn to link your document in these directories if you choose to, but if you're in a subdirectory you'll need to use an absolute address rather than a relative one to retrieve it online. To keep questionable material private, don't link the subdirectory to a public page, or keep the logs free from links to the media completely. 

It's better to start with a narrative or emotional content on paper beforehand anyway, to field responses carefully before you go live, and in some cases it should only be done if you really need to oppose a stated opinion with proof. 

If you already know you need to keep your media private, keep a record of the location of your media with you on paper, and your media off-line in a safe with Faraday protection. Whenever linking, or referring to a file or directory online (this includes required robot text files). Cloud technology does provide directories that do not reveal the names of your files but this is introductory level training intended to teach the value of adaptations we encounter as we proceed.

I've also included a datetime folder with the subdirectory logs that you can lockup with your media files. It's built with the structure of a standard calendar, but by using a folder for each month, year and day (be sure to allow for adaptations on leap years) you can be very selective about what you choose to lock up. 

There are also alternative calendars if you want to obscure the location of sensitive files by using a calendar based upon seasons with 13 weeks and 91 days per season for example if you'd prefer to keep things even more private. Managing the locations can be done fairly easily with a reference table that identifies what the standard calendar day is on the four seasons calendar.
